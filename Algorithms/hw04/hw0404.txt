Please first consider the following question: What are some good algorithms that can handle this? Just describe your strategy, don't write the code yet

description:

Corgi's high school project aimed to plan optimal patrol routes for police stations based on crime statistics using various algorithms. In an alternate universe, police agencies faced personnel reassignment after adopting the planning methods, conducting surveys to match officers' preferences. The task is to find the minimum accumulated officer shortage across all stations while meeting the officers' preferences.

Input:

The first line contain an integers N, represents the number of the police stations. The second line contain N integers aᵢ, represents the total number of patrol officers in i-th police station currently. The third line contain N integers bᵢ, represents the required total number of patrol officers in i-th police station before the patrol plan is implemented. The following N lines represent the results of the survey. The i-th line contains N integers xᵢⱼ, represents the number of officers who want to be reassigned from i-th police station to j-th police station. The integer xᵢᵢ in i-th line is guaranteed to be 0.
For all test data, it is guaranteed:
• 2 ≤ N ≤ 100
• 0 ≤ aᵢ, bᵢ ≤ 10^7
• 0 ≤ xᵢⱼ ≤ 10^5
• Σ xᵢⱼ ≤ aᵢ

Output:
Print the minimum accumulated shortage described in the problem, followed by a newline character.

Hint:
Solve the problem by maximum flow.
