NSFW, "上班不要看" is a famous YouTube channel in Taiwan. The boss, Froggy, is not only one of the company's establisher but also a former legislator. NSFW features various well-known projects such as "返鄉專車" and "忠孝東路走九遍" However, the most famous project in recent years is the expanding "走鐘獎."

One of the company's plans is to travel to every township in Taiwan. In other projects, Froggy get a title called "按讚惡鬼" while riding motorcycles and this project is named after that. Everyone starts the journey from Taipei, and the boss, Froggy, spins a roulette wheel to determine the riding partners and the next destination. The project finishes when the boss spins the wheel back to Taipei.

We will provide the distances between each neighboring township and the order of Froggy's destinations. Could you please help Froggy calculate the minimum distance he needs to ride?

Input:

The first line contains two numbers N, M, K indicating the number of townships, the number of bidirectional roads respectively, and the number of Froggy stops.
For next M lines, each line contains two townships' name ti, si and one number di to represent one road connecting between stops with distance di.
For next K lines, each line contains a townships is representing the order of Froggy stops.
For all test data, it is guaranteed:
• 2 ≤ N ≤ 300
• 1 ≤ M < N^2
• 2 ≤ K ≤ 1000
• 0 < di ≤ 1000
• Graph are connected
• Without self loop
• Township name without space
• The order of stop starts and ends are "Da'an_Taipei_City".


Output:
Please output the minimum distance about Froggy traveling townships.
