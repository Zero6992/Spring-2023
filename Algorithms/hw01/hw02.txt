Input
The first line contains N, M, where N represents the number of regions partitioned from the continent, and M represents the number of days. The second line contains N integers separated by spaces, representing array T in the problem. The i-th number, Ti, denotes the desired exploration progress on the i-th day. The next M lines indicate plans for day 1 to day M. In the following i-th line, it contains three integers u, v, k, separated by spaces. u and v represent the plan to explore from region u to region v, and k represents the increment exploration progress on the i-th day.
For all test data, it is guaranteed:
• 1≤ N ≤ 5 × 10^5
• 1 ≤ M ≤ 5 × 10^5
• 0≤Ti≤ 100
• 0 ≤ u ≤ v ≤ N − 1
0 ≤ k ≤ 100
Output
For each test data, output an integer denotes the number of the day when Corgi will complete his goal. If the answer doesn't exist, output -1 instead. Each output should be followed by a newline character.

Hint:
Try to store only the difference between adjacent elements in the array.
E.g. [2, 4, 3] => [0, 2, -1]
