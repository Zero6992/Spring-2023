Description
Wild European rabbits are a serious mammalian pest and invasive species in Australia causing millions of dollars' worth of damage crops.
Recently, Farmer, Joseph has found that there are many rabbit holes in his field. In order to catch these nasty rabbits, the farmer wants to fence holes in the field and set up some traps to catch these rabbit.
Can you help Joseph calculate that how much area, he will set traps?

Input
The first line contains one integer N, indicating the number of rabbit holes. In the next N lines, each line contains two integer Xi and Yi, representing the coordinate of rabbit hole Hi (1 ≤ i ≤ N)
• 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
• −2^30 ≤ Xi, Yi ≤ 2^30 – 1
Subtask 1 (30%)
• 1 ≤ N ≤ 10
• -100 ≤ Xi, Yi ≤ 100
Subtask 2 (30%)
• 1 ≤ N ≤ 100
• −65535 ≤ Xi, Yi ≤ 65535
Subtask 3 (40%)
No other restriction.

Output
Please output how much area, farmer Joseph will set traps.

Hint
Typically, the float has 7 significant digits while double has 15 significant digits. Please be careful about answer's precision.
