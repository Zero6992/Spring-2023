description
Carol is a foodie and today she visits a restaurant called NTNU CSIE. This restaurant is quite unique, as the owner only accepts specific coins that are powers of 2, such as 20 representing a coin worth 1, 21 representing a coin worth 2,22 representing a coin worth 4, and so on. For example: If the total amount is 5 dollars, then Carol has four ways to pay:
1. 1 + 1 + 1+1+1=5
2. 1+1 +1 + 2 = 5
3. 1+2 + 2 = 5
4. 1+ 4 = 5
Please help Carol calculate how many possible ways she can pay.

Input
A single line with a single integer, N. For all test data, it is guaranteed:
1 ≤ N ≤ 107
Subtask1
• 1 ≤ N ≤ 20
Subtask2
• 1≤ N ≤ 106
Subtask3
• No other restrictions.

Output
Output how many possible ways there are to make up the given amount. Since the number may be huge, you only need to answer the number module 1000000007(109 +7)

example 1
Input:
5
Output:
4

example 2
Input:
10
Output:
14

example 3
Input:
100
Output:
9828

Now implement it with C code
