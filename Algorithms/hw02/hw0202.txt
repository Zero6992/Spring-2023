Consider the following question: What are good algorithms that can handle this?

482 Question: BST
description

In Data Structure, we learned about binary search tree. For every parent node, those left nodes are smaller than the parent node and the right nodes are larger than it.

We define that the Maximum Path of a BST is a path from root node to one of leaf nodes and the sum of nodes on path is maximum.

Given a sequence 2 6 7 15 16 18 23, it can build many kinds of Binary Search Tree. 

The given tree is looks like this:    15 -> 6, 15 -> 18, 6 -> 2, 6 -> 7, 18 -> 16, 18 -> 23

In below example, the Maximum Path is 15 -> 18 -> 23 = 56.

Another Binary Search Tree's 16 -> 7, 16 -> 18, 7 -> 6, 7 -> 15, 18 -> 23, 6 -> 2

Maximum Path is 16 -> 18 -> 23 = 57.


Please find minimum of Maximum Path among all possible Binary Search Tree.

Input:

The first line contains a integer N, indicating the number of integers. The second line contains N integers ai.
• 1≤ N ≤ 400
• 0 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9
Subtask1
• 1≤ N ≤5
• 0 ≤ ai ≤ 100
Subtask2
• 1 ≤ N ≤ 10
• 0≤ ai ≤ 10000
Subtask3
• No other restriction

Output
