description:

In the recent post-COVID-19 pandemic era, many Taiwanese people have started to travel abroad, study abroad, or work overseas again. According to data from Flightradar24, the daily number of flights worldwide dropped to a record low of only 60,000 flights per day after the outbreak of COVID-19. However, in recent days, with the opening of borders in various countries, the number of flights has even exceeded the record during the peak travel season before the pandemic, reaching 220,000 flights per day.

Alan is a flight planner who has been assigned to rearrange all flight routes from his country to the Republic of Corgi ( ROC ). However, due to his frequent involvement in traffic accidents, he plans to adopt a safer planning strategy. Alan's country has N airports, while ROC has M airports. For simplicity, we assume that all airports in both countries are located on a pair of parallel east-west lines. Every airport in Alan's country is numbered from 1 to N from west to east, and every airport in ROC is also numbered from 1 to M from west to east.

Alan's planning strategy is as follows:

1. Only arrange flights from the given routes ( Domestic flights are ignored ).
2. All flights from airports must take off simultaneously.
3. Only one aircraft can take off from each airport at a time.
4. No two aircraft can land at the same airport.
5. Flight routes cannot intersect with each other.

Below is a diagram, where the arrows represent possible flight routes, and the green arrows represent one of the valid solutions.

Alan 1 -> ROC 2, Alan 2 -> ROC 4, Alan 3 -> ROC 2, Alan 4 -> ROC 1, Alan 4 -> ROC 5, Alan 5 -> ROC 4

Due to the new strategy mentioned above, Alan needs to report to his supervisor the efficiency of this strategy. Please help Alan find the maximum number of aircraft that can take off at once.
Input:
The first line contains two integers N, M, which has mentioned in the description above. The second line contains an integer R, representing the number of flight routes you can arrange. Each of the following lines
contains two integers, separated by spaces, representing a possible flight route that takes off at number airport in Alan's country and lands at number airport in ROC. Each flight route is unique.
For all test data, it is guaranteed:
• 1≤N, M, R≤ 10^6
• 1 ≤ R ≤ N*M
• 1≤ u ≤ N
• 1 ≤ v ≤ M

Subtask1(40%)
• 1≤ N, M, R ≤ 20
Subtask2(30%)
• 1≤ N, M, R ≤ 10^4
Subtask3(30%)
• No other restriction

Output
Print the maximum number of aircraft that can take off at once, followed by a newline character.

hint

1. How can we represent a valid arrangement of flight routes? Can you identify any patterns from the valid arrangements?
2. Make sure to check the data range.
3. You might want to take a look at non-programming homework if you have no idea.
