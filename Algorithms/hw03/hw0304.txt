Consider the following question: What are some good algorithms that can handle this? Just describe your strategy, don't write the code yet

Description:
This is a modified Nine-ball pool game with adjusted rules. 
The adjusted rules are as follows

RULE:
"""
1. All balls will be regrouped and give a group number

2, Make sure the ball in new group is sequential numbers without any gaps after all balls are grouped(original number of ball), which means for all the balls that are regrouped to the same group, they should not be separated by other number of ball.

3. If there are no balls with a group number higher than the previous pocketed ball's  group number, the player must strike the ball with the lowest  group number on the table.

4. Ensure that the group number of the ball being struck is greater than the group number of the previous pocketed ball, you can't hit a ball with same group before and after one hit

For example if there are 3 group in one input, the order can be
i.  1st group => 2nd group => 3rd group => 1st group .....
ii. 1st group => 3rd group => 1st group ......

5.  The second line which representing the sequence of shots, the ball in the continuous ascending sequence are all in different groups(This conclusion can be easily derived based on the rule.)

6.  Once there is only one  group number of ball left on the table, the player who pockets the ball first wins.
"""

--------------------

The following examples show how valid and invalid ways to regroup the balls.

Valid Example
"""
1, 2, 3, 4 => 1st group
5, 6 => 2nd group
7, 8, 9 => 3rd group
"""

Invalid Example
"""
1.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 => 1st group
Why: the corresponding new grouping sequence should be a non-decreasing sequence with 2 or more distinct groups.
2.
1 => 1st group
2, 3 => 2nd group
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 => 1st group
Why: the corresponding new grouping sequence should be a non-decreasing sequence
"""

For the valid example, if the number 3 ball is first ball pocketed, since the new number of the 3 ball is 1st group, only the ball with greater grouped number can be hit: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Therefore, a valid sequence of shots would be like """3(1st group)->7(3rd group)->4(1st group)->5(2nd group)->9(3rd group)->1(1st group)->6(2nd group)->8(3rd group->2(1st group)"""

Now, given a sequence of shots in a game, following the modification rule, please estimate the minimum need groups used in the game.

Input:
The first line contains two integers N, M separated by spaces. N represents the total number of ball and M represents the number of shots in a game. The second line contains M integers s; separated by spaces, representing the sequence of shots.
For all test data, it is guaranteed:
• 2 ≤ M ≤ N ≤ 10^6
• 1 ≤ si ≤ N

Output:
In order to play in a way that satisfies the rules and given input, output the minimum groups should the balls be divided, followed by a newline character. The answer is guaranteed > 1

example1 Input:
9 9
3 7 4 5 9 1 6 8 2
Expected output: 3

example2 Input:
20 2
1 3
Expected output: 2

example3 Input:
15 15
2 7 8 11 15 1 3 10 13 14 4 6 12 5 9
Expected Output: 6

example4 Input;
8 6
7 8 1 2 3 4
Expected output: 5

Example6 Input:
5 4
1 5 2 3
Expected output: 3



Please check if there are any misunderstanding in the question and process the example3 for practice
